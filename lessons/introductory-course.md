## :fox_face: Setting up a MetaMask Wallet

*What is a wallet?*

You can think of a wallet as a door to access cryptocurrencies you own. Only you have the private key, consisting of 64 alphanumerical characters. If anyone else knows your private key, they can access and transfer your cryptocurrencies. 

`e.g. 7de100578f780be29f9adb841026985824e9a7f948a2877c31e0d9cca756a080`

A private key is generated from a 12 word seed phrase unique to your wallet. Because anyone who knows your seed phrase can generate your private key, they can also access and transfer your cryptocurrencies. 

`e.g. black enough endless person bone term worry plastic detect distance sting employ`

It is important to remember that a wallet is only a tool to access and transfer your cryptocurrencies. If you accidentally uninstall your wallet extension or app, a record of your account still exists on the blockchain. As long as you remember you private key or seed, you will be able to access your crypto again.

*What is a blockchain?*

A blockchain is a collection of devices that are connected to each other through the internet. It is different from the internet because its main function is to keep track of quantifiable value in the form of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Bitcoin. Each device on the blockchain called a node. Nodes constantly communicate with each other, verifying that other nodes contain a truthful depiction of the balances of accounts on the blockchain. 

You will now create your first wallet using MetaMask. [Click here to install MetaMask and follow the instructions in the app](https://metamask.io/download.html). Remember to keep your seed phrase somewhere safe!

## :satellite: How to switch Metamask to the xDai network

By default, MetaMask is connected to the Ethereum network. You can verify this by looking at the top right of your MetaMask extension. Ether is the native currency of the Ethereum network and Ether account balances are constantly verified using blockchain technology. 

There are also other networks that are built to complement the Ethereum network. One of these networks is the xDai chain, which allows for fast and inexpensive transactions. It also has its own native currency, xDai. To learn about the blockchain in a relatively low-risk environment, we will be using the xDai chain. Feel free to explore other networks after this lesson. 

To connect to the xDai chain, we need to add it as a custom network. You can [follow the instructions on the official website here](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/wallets/metamask/metamask-setup). It is always recommended that you only add custom networks by following instructions in official documentation. Your network details should look something like this:

## :money_with_wings: How to get xDai

To interact with the blockchain, we need cryptocurrency. There are two main ways to get xDai: exchange fiat(government-backed currency) for crypto or through the xDai faucet. For our purposes, we will be using a faucet to receive xDai. 

*What is a faucet?*

A faucet is a place where you can request cryptocurrency to be sent to your address. Nowadays, there aren't many active faucets anymore.

>Fun fact: Bitcoin once had a faucet that gave five bitcoins per person. 

*What is an address?*

Remember your private key? Using the private key, an individual can also generate a public key that is simplified into a 42 character long address. If someone knows your address, they can view how much cryptocurrency you have in your account and send you crypto. 

It is safe to share your address because a private key can be used to generate a public key but a public key cannot be used to generate a private key.  

We will now use the faucet to send some xDai to our own address. Follow the [instructions on the official website to receive xDai in your wallet](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/get-xdai-tokens/xdai-faucet). You can copy your wallet address by tapping on it.
