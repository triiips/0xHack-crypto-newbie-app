## :key: Setting up a MetaMask Wallet

*What is a wallet?*

You can think of a wallet as a door to access cryptocurrencies you own. Only you have the private key, consisting of 64 alphanumerical characters. If anyone else knows your private key, they can access and transfer your cryptocurrencies. 

`e.g. 7de100578f780be29f9adb841026985824e9a7f948a2877c31e0d9cca756a080`

A private key is generated from a 12 word seed phrase unique to your wallet. Because anyone who knows your seed phrase can generate your private key, they can also access and transfer your cryptocurrencies. 

`e.g. black enough endless person bone term worry plastic detect distance sting employ`

It is important to remember that a wallet is only a tool to access and transfer your cryptocurrencies. If you accidentally uninstall your wallet extension or app, a record of your account still exists on the blockchain. As long as you remember you private key or seed, you will be able to access your crypto again.

*What is the blockchain?*

The blockchain is a collection of devices that are connected to each other through the internet. It is different from the internet because its main function is to keep track of quantifiable value in the form of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or Bitcoin. Each device on the blockchain called a node. Nodes constantly communicate with each other, verifying that other nodes contain a truthful depiction of the balances of accounts on the blockchain. 

You will now create your first wallet using MetaMask. [Click here to install MetaMask and follow the instructions in the app](https://metamask.io/download.html). Remember to keep your seed phrase somewhere safe!
